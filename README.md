# MandelbrotSet

## Interactive Mandelbrot set using Tkinter in python

### **What is the Mandelbrot set?**


A number $c$ on the complex plane is an element of the Mandelbrot set if it does not diverge when iterated to infinity with $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ from $z = 0$. In simpler terms, it's a special set of complex numbers that iterates over itself to produce an ever intricate and elaborate pattern whose complexity is best observed when you zoom into the boundaries.
_It's like an infinite loop of Russian dolls extending forever- except the level of intricacy is unparalleled._

In our interactive display of the Mandelbrot set, we let you set customizable bounds to select the reference point with which to zoom in or out. The most interesting facet of the visuals can be observed by zooming into the borders of the shape!

We also added colors to depict the speed at which each recursive sequence crosses the threshold of (). A red color signifies () and a bluer color signifies ().
